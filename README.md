## EnergyTime

[NexusMods Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/6488)

### Overview and Goal

This mod lets time pass proportionally to your energy usage. You can also fast forward by (default) pressing and holding the 'U' key.

The inspiration for this mod comes from the relaxed feeling when there is no time constraint in games like Littlewood. I always found myself modifying the default time passage, often freezing it as a result. In the end, I prefer the approach in games like Littlewood and wanted something similar for Stardew hence this mod.

### Configuration Options

Configuration options are listed below, with their default values.

```
  "EnergyRequirementMultiplier": 1,
  "PassTimeKey": "U"
```

To modify how quickly your energy depletion makes time pass, tweak the `EnergyRequirementMultiplier` configuration value. The higher the value, the more energy must be expended for a 10 minute tick to pass.

### Compatibility

This mod should not impact most other mods, however there is a high likelihood of conflicts with other mods that manipulate time mechanics in the game.

### Feedback

I'm open to suggestions for improvements and tweaks, but have a full time job and other responsibilities. This is very much just something I did for fun for myself that I wanted to share so please bear with me if I take some time to respond to improvement suggestions.

That said, I shall do my best to address any critical bugs in a timely fashion.
